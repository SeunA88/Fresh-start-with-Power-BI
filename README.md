# Fresh start with Power BI

---
The journey to learning Power BI starts with the basics of importing data into Power BI desktop from different sources. In this task, two sets of data were imported into Power BI desktop from Excel, a csv file and from SQL.

The files were imported through the **get data** portal in Power BI. For the Excel csv file, this option was selected from the drop down list and the browse tab was used to get the file location and upload the file into Power BI desktop.

For the SQL file, only the top 25 rows of the dataset was imported to the Power BI desktop. This was achieved by writing out a query in Power BI Desktop to select out only 25 rows, after selacting the SQL path for data upload.


Please find below screenshots of the achieved results.
