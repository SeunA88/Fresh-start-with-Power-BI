# Fresh start with Power BI

---
The journey to learning Power BI starts with the basics of importing data into Power BI desktop from different sources. In this task, two sets of data were imported into Power BI desktop from Excel, a csv file and from SQL.

The files were imported through the **get data** portal in Power BI. For the Excel csv file, this option was selected from the drop down list and the browse tab was used to get the file location and upload the file into Power BI desktop.

Please find below screenshots of the achieved result.

For the SQL file, the same Excel csv file was first uploaded into a database in SQL, and then only the top 25 rows of the dataset was imported to the Power BI desktop. This was achieved by writing out a query in Power BI Desktop to select out only 25 rows, after selecting the SQL path for data upload.


Please find below screenshots of the achieved results.


After this, anorher datase4; Employee data(Excel csv format) was imported into the Power BI desktop and data cleaning was then carried out on this dataset. Steps involved were:
- Removal of duplicates
- Datatype corrections, standardization and formatting e.g. currency and text datatypes
- Column naming to suit the data therein.


Also, joining/ merging of tables was done in this task. Two other tables in Excel csv file format were imported into the Power BI desktop;
- Salary data 
- Department data 
  
These datasets shared a common column with each other and the Employee dataset. This common column served as the joining platform for the three tables.
The three tables were joined one after the other using Join table function in Power BI and turnwd into a single table containing all the information from the three tables..


Please find below the result of the data cleaning mentioned above and the merged/joined table.
